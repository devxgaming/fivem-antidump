# fivem-antidump client side + nui


please download ```dev-antidump``` with ```full-antidump-ready```
<br><br>
```full-antidump-ready``` is ready resource, you can put your code inside it and after finish change the folder name to your resource name<br>
<br>
the description is inside files, so make sure to open all file in full-antidump-ready and read it before store your code inside it.<br><br>
```dev-antidump``` is only server side, can read the file and ban players
<br>

## I recommend using it together

# fixed

sometime the trigger OnPlayerLoaded or player spawn send to client side but antidump was not loaded the scripts because of ```[framework load player fast, ping, bad connection]```. and your scripts not working on the player, so i have fix the problem by add some code on client.lua and public.lua

for example:

inside public.lua
```lua
local WaitUntilLoaded = true

-- change the event when player loaded or player spwan like your framework. i use here QBCore
RegisterNetEvent('QBCore:Client:OnPlayerLoaded', function()
    CreateThread(function()
        while WaitUntilLoaded do Wait(0) end
        TriggerEvent('YourTriggerNameInsideClient.lua')
        -- or triggerServerEvent
        -- please don't use same event name on all your resource, use like: resource-name:client:OnPlayerLoaded
        -- if you use same event name, think about how many resource you have and how manytime it's will send the trigger
    end)
end)

AddEventHandler('onResourceStart', function(resource)
    if resource == GetCurrentResourceName() then
        Wait(100)
        CreateThread(function()
            while WaitUntilLoaded do Wait(0) end
            TriggerEvent('YourTriggerNameInsideClient.lua')
        end)
    end
end)

function LoadSuccess()
    WaitUntilLoaded = false
end

exports('LoadSuccess', LoadSuccess)
```

added this at the last line of your code in client.lua

```lua
CreateThread(function() exports['your-resource-name']:LoadSuccess() end)

```

and you ready to go.
<br><br>
Note: i didn't added this code inside full-antidump-ready you should do it manuel.


## new issue
if player network changed, for example from Ethernet to WIFI, it's will stay on the server, but [sometimes] Fivem reload all client script
so when Fivem client reload all script, player will got ban because the id of player has registered on `ResourceRequested`, so if you want to fix this issue. you have 2 choices <br>
`1-` after check player, unban?<br>
`2-` change `exports['dev-antidump']:BanPlayer(src, reason)` to `DropPlayer(src, reason)` in full-antidump-ready/server.lua:69<br>
<br><br>Note: this issue is happened only when player network changed.<br>
for my own server, i have choiced `1`


# note
a lot of people adding more resource inside `full-antidump-ready` config, for example `config1.lua` `config2.lua` `client.lua` `client2.lua`<br>
and his adding me on discord to asking about where is error?<br><br>
please don't load more resource in one full-antidump-ready because of:

* your script will not working
* if is working can client side take timeout disconnect.

why is not working?
let we say you have 2 config file for 2 resource.<br>
if you load config 1 there is no problem<br>
but when antidump load config 2 it removing the config 1 because your config 2 also has `config = {}`<br>
now you say ok i will remove `config = {}` from the config 2, yes but there another problem if your config has same key in config 2 it will replaced to config 2 for example

config 1:
```lua
config = {}

config.position = Vector3(0, 0, 0)

```

config 2:
```lua
config.position = vectro3(0, 0, 0)

```
here position in config 1 will replaced also to position in config 2<br>


so please don't load 2 resource in one `full-antidump-ready`, just copy `full-antidump-ready` and make another one for other resources

if your player taking timeout disconnect, just use queue it will resolve the problem, information about queue is on server.lua in `full-antidump-ready`, and make sure to update `dev-antidump`
